# Mutation testing examples

Some examples of simple methods and unit tests that give 100% code coverage, however, for various reasons will fail StrykerJS's mutation tests.

- These tests are sometimes contrived and deliberately bad for demo purposes
- You will likely spot plenty of missing tests you would write in the real world
- So, generally a mutation report won't be as bad as this (I'd hope!)
- But, even experienced developers won't be infallible and could miss some scenarios
- It's okay to not have a 100% mutation-free set of tests, this tool is to make you question the tests.
